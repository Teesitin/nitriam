        Once upon a time, in a serene meadow surrounded by ancient forests, there lived a unicorn unlike any other.
        This unicorn wasn't your typical graceful and majestic creatureâ€”no, this unicorn was edgy, rebellious, and had a penchant for music that rocked the soul.
        With a shimmering coat of midnight blue and a mane that sparkled like starlight, our edgy unicorn would often sneak away from the rest of the herd to a secluded field where wildflowers danced in the breeze.
        It was here, under the canopy of a thousand twinkling stars, that the unicorn indulged in its secret passion: listening to Deftones.
